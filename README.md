# Krino: The ODEA Forensic Intelligence Framework
> OPEN-SOURCE • DFIR • EDR • AI  <br>
> Stable releases are documented in the GitHub Releases section | 2025.12.10 ~  <br>
> Current file timestamps: UTC-5 (EST) <br>

> Initial inference performance evaluation of the v3.0.0 LLM base model is currently in progress.  
All LLM-related source code is being researched and version-controlled in a private repository.  
The initial base model setup, inference test scripts, configuration details, and directory structure will be published in this repository at a later stage.

## Open-Source EDR + DFIR + LLM + Threat Intelligence System

**ODEA Krino** is a platform that integrates WinRM-based remote collection,
behavior-based detection using Chainsaw and Sigma rules,
system telemetry via Osquery,
and DFIR artifact collection using Velociraptor.

The project is designed to conduct research on  
**AI-driven Threat Intelligence and DFIR automation**,  
with a focus on validating end-to-end architecture rather than individual tools.

> The most important aspect of this project is not whether a bottleneck
> can be fully resolved, but whether the right decision is made to reach
> the ultimate goal—even if that requires changing tools or direction.

> In a single-architect design and implementation environment,
> clear prioritization between code completeness and rapid MVP delivery
> is required.

> ODEA KRINO prioritizes MVP realization over perfection
> and continues progressing to the next stage whenever bottlenecks are encountered.

This README represents **Full Architecture v1.5**,
covering AI setup, data structure, pipeline design, and LLM integration strategy.
It defines the complete roadmap from **v1 to v6**.

Current research phase: **v3 ~ v6**  
~~The MISP Threat Intelligence Pipeline was planned from v2.2~~  
> Due to attribute-related issues, MISP integration will proceed after LLM training.
